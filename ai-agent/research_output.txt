An AI agent is an automated system that uses artificial intelligence techniques to autonomously perform tasks or solve problems. These agents can act independently within specific environments, process information from those environments, and make decisions based on their programming and learned experiences. AI agents can range from simple rule-based systems to complex machine learning models and can be applied in various domains such as robotics, virtual assistants, and gaming.
